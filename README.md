# World_Happiness_Score

This project is to help people understand what makes people happy based data in the World Happiness Report 2020. Happiness is hard to quantify and it varies on countries, social events, environmental factors, social economic status, individual personalities and many others factors. By bringing in data analysis and machine learning techniques, I want to have a better understanding of what and how different factors may affect happiness, and predict happiness score on country-level. 

Variable Definitions and the complete World Happiness Report are also included.
